# Welcome!

This is the 
externally accessible 
web-page for
[COMS10015: Computer Architecture](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?unitCode=COMS10015),
a unit operated by the 
[School of Computer Science](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/schools/computer-science),
[University of Bristol (UoB)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk).
Quoting the catalogue entry, the remit of this unit can be summarised as follows:

{: .notice--info}
 <div markdown='block' style='font-style: italic'>
[...] this unit delivers an introduction to computer architecture: the focus is on bridging the gap between high-level programming languages and the hardware (e.g., micro-processors) on which associated programs execute. The unit content can be described as three main topics, which gradually build from lower to higher level concepts:

1. From Mathematics and Physics to digital logic:
   - Boolean algebra; integer representation and arithmetic,
   - physical design of logic components (e.g., logic gates from transistors),
   - use of combinatorial logic components (e.g., Karnaugh maps),
   - use of sequential logic components (e.g., state machines).
2. From digital logic to computer processors:
   - processor paradigms: counter, accumulator, stack, and register machines; von Neumann vs. Harvard architecture; RISC vs. CISC,
   - memory paradigms: von Neumann bottleneck, memory hierarchy; cache memories,
   - instruction set design: instruction classes; addressing modes; instruction encoding and decoding,
   - processor design: buses; control and data paths; ALU; microcoded vs. hardwired control; fetch-decode-execute cycle.
3. From computer processors to software applications:
   - development tools: assembly language; assembly and linkage processes; debuggers,
   - support for structured programming (e.g., function calls),
   - support for operating systems (e.g., interrupts, protection).

Note that

- An associated 
  [GitHub](https://github.com/)-based [repo.](https://github.com/cs-uob/COMS10015)
  houses the source code for this web-site, plus various other
  resources which might be useful.
- Although this
  external-facing
  web-site hosts as much
   *static* content
  as possible, the unit cannot and so is not entirely
  "[Blackboard](https://www.blackboard.com)-free".
  Selected
  internal-facing,
  *dynamic* content
  is only accessible via other means: important examples include

  1. unit-wide communication, e.g., announcements (Blackboard),
  2. assessment submission, marks, and feedback   (Blackboard),
  3. discussion forum                             (Teams).
